# Midi Keyboard Soundboard
Simple WPF desktop app that configures a midi keyboard (or midi pad controller) to be a soundboard. Tested with an AKAI LPD 8.

Feel free to raise issues or create pull requests.

## Motivation
The motivation for me to create this project is that I couldn't find any software (except https://github.com/astromme/midi-keyboard-sounds) that allows me to simply configure sounds with my midi pad controller. There is a lot of software out there that allows me to do this (like ableton), except this comes with a lot more (unused) functionalities. That means that I only use the tip of the iceberg.
